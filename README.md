# UltraLeap Button

To run this app run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

As I can't use the touch plane I mimiced it by using a timer to increment the progessToClick value while
the mouse is hovered over the input button. Moving the cursor off the button cancels the timer and resets
progessToClick.
